Phaser is our framework
- A foundation around which you build your game
An engine is...
- Full feature toolset upon which you build an app

init() - prepares any data for the scene
preload() - prepares any assets we'll need for the scene
create() - adds assets to the scene
update() - loop run continuously at (hopefully) our chosen frame rate
